# About Us 

We are a support network of Australians who have been contractors working in the United Kingdom and now caught up in the 2019 Loan Charge.

Our aim is to come together to support each other and to strive for a fair outcome and aligning ourselves closely with the [Loan Charge Action Group](https://www.hmrcloancharge.info/).

If you are affected, please [get in touch](contact-us).
