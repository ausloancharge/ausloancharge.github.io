# About Us

We believe the Australian Tax Office (ATO) is accepting foreign tax claims onto the Australian foreign tax register that are unlawful.

We are a support network of Australians who find themselves in this situation, most commonly contractors who worked in the United Kingdom now subject to the Loan Charge.

Our aim is to come together to support each other and to strive for a fair outcome and aligning ourselves closely with the [Loan Charge Action Group](https://www.hmrcloancharge.info/).


## UK Loan Charge

You may or may not have received correspondence from HMRC regarding the UK Loan Charge if you are affected,
but generally, if you have ever engaged the services of these companies, the Loan Charge may apply to you.
