    <h1 class="display-4">Aussies against the Loan Charge</h1>
    <p><b>Retrospective law is evil -- all Australians deserve certainty in their affairs.</b></p>
    <p><b>Foreign claims should only be raised for non contested tax charges - not tax in dispute (this includes APNs and the 2019 Loan charge)</b></p>
    <p>We are a support group for Australians who are now caught up in the UK 2019 Loan Charge, working very closely with the <a href="https://www.hmrcloancharge.info/">Loan Charge Action Group</a>.</p>
    <p>If you worked in the UK in the last 20 years as a contractor and have received a <i>brown</i> envelope from HMRC, or a notice from the ATO, you should get in touch with us.</p>
